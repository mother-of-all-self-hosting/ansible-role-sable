# Setting up Sable

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Sable](https://github.com/7w1/sable) (a fork of [Cinny](https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny)) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

Sable is a web client for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), realtime communication (chat) network. It focuses primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface.

See the project's [documentation](https://github.com/7w1/sable) to learn what Sable does and why it might be useful to you.

>[!NOTE]
> This role merely enables you to set up the client; To communicate with other people on the Matrix network you need to prepare a Matrix homeserver which this client can connect to. While it is still possible to use a public homeserver with the Sable instance, [this "matrix-docker-ansible-deploy" Ansible playbook](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/) lets you set up Matrix services from the core ones such as a homeserver to other goodies like "bridges" on your server — it is pretty complete and well maintained.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable Sable with this role, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

**Note**: the path should be something like `inventory/host_vars/mash.example.com/vars.yml` if you use the [MASH Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# sable                                                                #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

sable_enabled: true

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /sable                                                               #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### Set the hostname

To enable Sable you need to set the hostname as well. To do so, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `example.com` with your own value.

```yaml
sable_hostname: "example.com"
```

After adjusting the hostname, make sure to adjust your DNS records to point the domain to your server.

**Note**: hosting Sable under a subpath (by configuring the `sable_path_prefix` variable) does not seem to be possible due to Sable's technical limitations.

### Set the default homeserver URL

It is also necessary to specify the default homeserver's URL by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
sable_default_hs_url: YOUR_HOMESERVER_URL_HERE
```

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the service.

Take a look at:

- [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml) for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file
- [`templates/config.json.j2`](../templates/config.json.j2) for the component's default configuration. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `sable_configuration_extension_json` variable

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the installation command of your playbook as below:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

If you use the MASH playbook, the shortcut commands with the [`just` program](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

## Usage

After running the command for installation, Sable becomes available at the specified hostname like `https://example.com`.

To get started, open the URL with a web browser, and log in to your homeserver with the Matrix account.

## Troubleshooting

### Check the service's logs

You can find the logs in [systemd-journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) by logging in to the server with SSH and running `journalctl -fu sable` (or how you/your playbook named the service, e.g. `mash-sable`).
